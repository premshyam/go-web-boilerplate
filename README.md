This is a simple go web boilerplate for you to get started with building REST APIs

## Rules

### Branch naming conventions

1. **Feature Branches**: If you're working on a new feature or user story, prefix the branch name with "feature/" followed by a brief and descriptive name of the feature. For example:

   ```
   feature/user-authentication
   feature/payment-processing
   ```

2. **Bug Fix Branches**: If you're fixing a bug, prefix the branch name with "bugfix/" followed by a brief and descriptive name of the bug or the issue being addressed. For example:

   ```
   bugfix/navigation-menu-bug
   bugfix/database-connection-issue
   ```

3. **Hotfix Branches**: If you're working on an urgent fix for a critical issue in production, prefix the branch name with "hotfix/" followed by a brief and descriptive name of the issue. For example:

   ```
   hotfix/security-vulnerability
   hotfix/critical-crash-fix
   ```

4. **Release Branches**: When preparing for a release, create a branch specifically for the release. You can prefix the branch name with "release/" followed by the version or release name. For example:

   ```
   release/1.2.0
   release/spring-update
   ```

5. **Refactoring or Maintenance Branches**: For larger refactoring efforts or general maintenance tasks, prefix the branch name with "refactor/" or "maintenance/" followed by a brief description. For example:

   ```
   refactor/cleanup-codebase
   maintenance/update-dependencies
   ```

6. **Experimental Branches**: If you're working on experimental or exploratory features, prefix the branch name with "experimental/" followed by a brief description. For example:
   ```
   experimental/machine-learning-integration
   experimental/new-ui-design
   ```

Remember, the key is to maintain consistency within your team or organization. It's also a good practice to have a branching strategy or workflow documented and communicated to ensure everyone understands and follows the conventions.
